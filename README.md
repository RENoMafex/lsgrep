# lsgrep

A shellscript to automatically pipe the output from `ls -lAh` to `grep`. If you have [grc](https://github.com/garabik/grc) installed, it will colorize the output like it would with `grc ls -lAh`.

## Installation

**1.**

Download `lsgrep` either by clicking the green <font color=#00ff00> <> Code </font> button.
